- # Methodology

This project employs a comprehensive approach, integrating advanced imaging techniques and machine learning algorithms to enhance the early detection of osteoporosis in Para Athletes.

## Data Collection

Knee X-ray images of adult patients were collected from a verified website. The dataset includes both osteoporotic and normal conditions, providing a diverse range of cases for training and testing.

## Data Pre-Processing

Faster R-CNN pre-processing algorithms were utilized to improve detection efficiency. The following steps were performed:

1. **Linear Smooth:** Removing noise from the image using a linear smooth filter.
2. **Median Filtering:** Applying median filtering to enhance image quality.
3. **Gaussian Smooth:** Employing a 2-D Gaussian function for feature extraction.
4. **Gray Scale Threshold:** Adjusting gray scale values by eliminating pixels above and below a certain range.

These steps, combined with Faster R-CNN, result in improved image quality and efficient feature extraction.

## Feature Extraction and Segmentation

To enhance robustness and accuracy, an approach that decomposes X-ray images into a bone segmented representation using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was employed. The HRFormer model, a segmentation model based on transformers, was utilized for this purpose.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Following segmentation, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were trained to classify bone images into categories, including osteoporosis, low bone mass density, and normal bone mass density. T-score values were used for categorization.
