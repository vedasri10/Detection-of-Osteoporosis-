# Detection-of-Osteoporosis-
# Improving Early Detection of Osteoporosis for Para Athletes

## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing the early detection of osteoporosis in Para Athletes through the utilization of bone densitometry functionalities and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The systematic approach aims to provide a reliable solution for assessing bone health in individuals with physical disabilities.
